## Vote CUPE
</br>

Dear CUPE supporters,
</br></br>
The Labour Board has issued the official notice of the upcoming vote for part-time and casual clerical employees at Toronto Western Hospital to join CUPE.
</br></br>
**Time: Thursday, June 7 1:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.**  
**Location: TWH Main Pavilion - 5th floor, Room 316**
</br></br>
You must vote in-person at this poll during the time indicated. The Ontario Labour Relations Board does not accept proxy, distance or online voting.
</br></br>
The question on the ballot will be: "In your employment relations with your Employer, do you wish to be represented by the union?‚Äù In order to be successful, majority (50%+1) of voters must vote YES.
</br></br>
A Labour Board Officer will oversee the vote. Both CUPE and the Employer are allowed 1 scrutineer each at the poll. Your vote is confidential and the employer will never know how you vote. The secrecy of the vote is protected by law.
</br></br>
In the unusual circumstance that your name does not appear on the voters list, you will still be permitted to vote. The Labour Board Officer will explain to you that your vote will be double enveloped and segregated until your employment information can be verified at a later date. Your vote will still be unidentifiable and confidential.
</br></br>
